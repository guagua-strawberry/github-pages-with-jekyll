About BAF UI style guide
Introduce the BAF style guide
The BAF UI style guide is based on SAP Fiori 3.0 and it includes all the resources needed to create an overall consistent experience when designing for SME products. It describes how the user interfaces for SAP SME products are constructed, the interaction logic between pages and the essential rules that shapes SME product. 

## Structure
-	Foundations introduces the general concept of BAF style guide and some essential rule the products need to follow;
-	Layouts introduces the frequently-used page structure that solve user's most-occurring problems;
-	Floorplans and Patterns explains the pattern-based design concept and the hierarchy of UI patterns;
-	Elements concentrates on generic UI rules and controls.
-	
## The benefits
Having this style guide has the following benefits:
-	Making the overall product user experience consistent
-	Significantly lower the development cost for developers and designers

## The users 
-	For designers, it serves as an end-to-end design language to guide designers to create simple, intuitive and consistent experiences.
-	For developers, it teaches developers UI concepts relevant for the UI implementation;
-	For product manager, it helps PMs leverage the opportunity to deliver an extraordinary product;
-	For user assistance development managers, it clarifies documentation relevant parts of the UI concept;

## Stencil
Intro
Design stencils are ready-to-use, high-fidelity drafts of BAF UI components. You can use them to visualize SME products and to get a realistic impression of your final design.

Content
The BAF UI design stencils include:
•	Patterns for foundation topics, such as shadow levels, grid, colors, and more
•	Page types (floorplans)
•	Controls (Still reusing Fiori controls, meanwhile adding new ones)
•	Helper tools, such as rem squares or px spacings to build your app according to the current specifications and implementations. We’ve also included interaction tools, such as like cursors and touch visualizations.

# Design Guidelines
## Leverage Fiori widgets under ONE UX vision.
SAP Fiori 3.0+ is the user experience (UX) paradigm for SAP SME software and applications.
All product areas committed to work towards the adoption of SAP Fiori 3 as the design system that would integrate the experience of all SAP products. This decision was operationalized in a newly established product standard for UX consistency. 
As well as a new Quartz theme, SAP Fiori 3 introduced a number of new features that facilitate the integration of all SAP products to provide one coherent and consistent user experience.
SME Products have their historical UX paradigm and an existing customer.
Fiori3+ defines the UX-bridge between existing SAP SME UX Concepts and functions and the SAP Fiori 3 UX Concepts and functions.

## Keep the current BYD information structure with role-based supportive task flow.
By understanding different user need and business process, the product 
should come up with personalized solution to simplify their workflow and increase their productivity. 

## Provide feedback flow within user interaction.
As stated in Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principle for interaction design, "Visibility of system status: The design should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time."

Our product should provide noticeable feedback to build trust within every user interaction: when user know about the current system status, they can predict the outcome of their prior interactions and determine their next move. Predictable interaction can create trust in the product as well as the brand.

## A consistent, aesthetic, straightforward interface. 
Consistent – Consistent interface makes product intuitive and understandable. It reduces customer confusion when completing goals. 
 
Aesthetic – Well-crafted product is essential to increase user's joy of use. Good looking products and user interfaces are perceived as more valuable and easier to use than the ugly ones.
 
Straightforward – Self-explanatory product can help user learn to use our product better.
 
The combination of all these three important traits can make sure the product delivered meet our product standard and customer satisfaction.
